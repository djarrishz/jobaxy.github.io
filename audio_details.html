                            Sometimes this question can also be asked like â€œWhat were your expectations from your
                            previous
                            company/job?
                        </p>
                        <p> This question allows employers to know what expectations you have or had from the previous
                            job
                            or organization and how reasonable and realistic is/was it. Also how well they were met in
                            your
                            previous job or how well it can be met in the job that you are applying for. They also want
                            to
                            know how you will be a good fit for the position.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is no one definite answer to this. Neither there is any right or wrong answer. You
                            should
                            always be professional and honest while answering any of your interview questions and this
                            question is no exception. Set a realistic expectation from your job/company. The
                            expectations
                            should always be in the best interest of you and the company alike.
